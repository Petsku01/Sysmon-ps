Comprehensive Guide to Using Sysmon PowerShell Scripts
Overview of Sysmon

Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service that logs system activity to the Windows Event Log. It provides detailed information about process creation, network connections, and file changes, which is invaluable for monitoring and incident response in cybersecurity.
Prerequisites

    Sysmon Installation:
        Download Sysmon from the Microsoft Sysinternals website.
        Unzip the downloaded file to a directory on your system.

    PowerShell:
        Ensure you have PowerShell installed (usually pre-installed on Windows).
        Run PowerShell as an administrator to ensure you have the necessary permissions.

    Execution Policy:
        You may need to adjust the PowerShell execution policy to run scripts:

        powershell

        Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Best Practices

    Regular Monitoring: Schedule the scripts to run at regular intervals using Windows Task Scheduler for continuous monitoring.

    Sysmon Configuration: Customize your Sysmon configuration file to log only the necessary events based on your organizationâ€™s needs. This reduces noise in the logs and focuses on the most relevant events.

    Log Management: Consider implementing a log management solution to centralize and analyze logs from Sysmon and other sources for better incident response capabilities.

    Review and Update: Regularly review and update your scripts and Sysmon configurations to adapt to evolving threats and organizational changes.

    Test in Controlled Environments: Before deploying scripts in a production environment, test them in a controlled setting to avoid any disruptions.
